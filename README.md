Oh hai
============

You must really have no life, because you've just stumbled upon the (perhaps inappropriately named) official repo for the website of the Equality in Gaming Organization (a.k.a EGO) at I-Poly HS! It's based on on Synchronus by Templated (check them out!), and will be maintained by Matthew (West House sophomore), Scott (South House sophomore), and Matthew (West House sophomore).

Reporting bugs:
If you want to report a bug or an error, send any one of us an email with a subject line prefixed with [BUG]. If it's an error, please tell us where exactly we can find it. If it's a bug, please give us as much info as you can about it - what browser you were using, what type of device, et cetera - and give us exact instructions on how to reproduce the bug. Do NOT just say something like "Hey, there's a bug on the home page"! It makes ironing out bugs a whole lot easier if we know exactly what we're looking for.

And, if at any time you feel the need to ask for an ETA (which, given the nature of the project, we don't think you will, but you never know), don't.
