Oh, hai!
============

You must really have no life, because you've just stumbled upon the (perhaps inappropriately named) official repo for the website of the Equality in Gaming Organization (a.k.a EGO) at I-Poly HS! It's based on on Synchronus by Templated (check them out!), and will be maintained by Matthew (West House sophomore), Scott (South House sophomore), and Matthew (West House sophomore).

[REPORTING BUGS] If you want to report a bug or an error, send any one of us an email with a subject line prefixed with [BUG]. If it's an error, please tell us where exactly we can find it. If it's a bug, please give us as much info as you can about it - what browser you were using, what type of device, et cetera - and give us exact instructions on how to reproduce the bug. Do NOT just say something like "Hey, there's a bug on the home page"! It makes ironing out bugs a whole lot easier if we know exactly what we're looking for.
